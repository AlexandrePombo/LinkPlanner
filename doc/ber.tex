\section{BER}

\subsection*{Functional Description}

This block accepts two binary strings and outputs a binary string, outputting a 1 if the two input samples are equal to each other and 0 if not. This block also outputs a \textit{.txt} file with a report of the calculate BER as well as the estimated Confidence bounds for a given probability $1-\alpha$. The probability for the confidence bounds is determined by the $z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ percentile of a standard gaussian distribution, value which has to be fed into the block.
